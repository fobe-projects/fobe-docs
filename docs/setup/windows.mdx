The following instructions assume a 64-bit installation of Windows 10.

## Prerequisites

Before you are ready to run Saleor, you will need additional software installed on your computer.

### Python

Saleor requires **Python 3.8** or later. Go to the [Python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for your operating system's installer and installation guide. You can also use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install and manage Python versions.

Make sure “**Add Python 3.8 to PATH**” is selected.

### Node.js

Saleor requires **Node.js 10.0** or later. Go to the [Node.js downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for the installer. We recommend using the `.msi` format.

### PostgreSQL

You will need **PostgreSQL** version **15.x**. Get the Windows installer from the [project’s download page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/).

:::note
Remember the password you chose for the administrator account during the installation process.
:::

### GTK+

Download and install the [64-bit Windows installer](https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer).

Make sure that “**Set up PATH environment variable to include GTK+**” is selected.

### Compilers

Download and install the latest version of the [Build Tools for Visual Studio](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=840931).

## Installation

Once you have installed or updated the pre-requisite software, you are ready to install Saleor. Follow the steps below to start and execute the process:

:::note
All commands need to be performed in either a PowerShell terminal or a Windows Command Prompt.
:::

### Installing Saleor

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/saleor/saleor.git
    cd saleor
    ```

2.  Make sure you have [Poetry installed](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

3.  Install the dependencies:

```shell
poetry install
```

4.  Create a database user using the command line tools that came with your PostgreSQL installation:

    ```shell
    C:\"Program Files"\PostgreSQL\15\bin\createuser.exe --username=postgres --superuser --pwprompt saleor
    ```

    Please correct the path if your installation path or PostgreSQL version are different.

    When asked to choose a password for the new role, use "saleor" (or see [how to configure Saleor to use a different password](setup/configuration.mdx#database_url)). When asked for your password, give the one you set during the installation of PostgreSQL.

    :::caution
    If you've decided to substitute your own credentials, make sure you create a "superuser". Otherwise, the user won't be able to install all the necessary database extensions.
    :::

5.  Create a database:

    ```shell
    C:\"Program Files"\PostgreSQL\15\bin\createdb.exe --username=postgres --owner=saleor saleor
    ```

6.  Migrate the database:

    ```shell
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

    :::caution
    This command creates database extensions. If you get an error related to the `CREATE EXTENSION` command, please return to the user creation step above.
    :::

7.  Create a super user account to access the dashboard

    ```shell
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

### Starting the API server

For production use, use the official Docker images. For development purposes, you can run the API server with the following command:

```shell
poetry run uvicorn saleor.asgi:application --reload
```

### Installing the dashboard

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/saleor/saleor-dashboard.git
   cd saleor-dashboard
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

### Running the dashboard

For production use, use the official Docker images. For development purposes, follow the instructions below.

Set the `API_URI` environment variable to your local API server's URL:

<Tabs defaultValue="cmd" values={[
  { label: "Command Prompt", value: "cmd" },
  { label: "PowerShell", value: "ps" }
]}>
<TabItem value="cmd">

```shell
set API_URI "http://localhost:8000/graphql/"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ps">

```shell
$Env:API_URI = "http://localhost:8000/graphql/"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

From within the `saleor-dashboard` directory, run the following command:

```shell
npm start
```

Your local dashboard should be accessible by visiting [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/).

   ```shell
   pnpm install
   ```
