FoBE Studio products are neither intended nor authorized for use in products or systems that may pose a direct threat to human life or bodily injury (e.g., artificial life support devices or systems, surgical implantations), or may cause serious property damage (e.g., nuclear reactor control systems, military equipment).

**8. CUSTOMER'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR SAFETY**

Although FoBE Studio endeavors to improve the quality and reliability of its products, semiconductor products have specific characteristics, such as the occurrence of failure at a certain rate and malfunctions under certain use conditions. Furthermore, FoBE Studio products are not subject to radiation resistance design.

Such safety measures include, but are not limited to, safety design for hardware and software, redundancy, fire control and malfunction prevention, and appropriate treatment for aging degradation. As the evaluation of microcomputer software alone is very difficult, you are responsible for evaluating the safety of the final products or systems you manufacture.
