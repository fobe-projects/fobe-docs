## Introduction

The FoBE Quill ESP32-S3 Mesh is a compact and feature-rich IoT development platform, integrating Espressif's high-performance multi-protocol SoC ESP32-S3 and Semtech's ultra-low-power sub-GHz radio transceiver SX1262 (SiP package). Designed for IoT applications, it provides a comprehensive wireless connectivity solution supporting IEEE 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5, Thread, Zigbee, and LoRa®.

This development board features efficient battery charging management, discrete power path, ultra-low quiescent current DC-DC converter, a 1.3-inch 16-pin OLED display (SSD1312 driver), user-programmable LED and button, MFP expansion connector, reversible USB-C connector, and easy-to-expand pin headers, making it ideal for rapid prototyping and development.
