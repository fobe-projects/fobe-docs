# FoBE Quill ESP32-S3 Mesh

#### A Development Kit featuring the ESP32-S3 and integrated SX1262 LoRa Connect transceiver.

## Introduction

The FoBE Quill ESP32-S3 Mesh is a compact and versatile IoT solution development platform. It combines Espressif's high-end multiprotocol SoC ESP32-S3 with Semtech's ultra-low power sub-GHz radio transceiver SX1262 (packaged using SiP technology). Specifically designed for IoT, it provides a complete wireless connectivity solution supporting IEEE 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 5, Thread, Zigbee, and LoRa®.

This development board is equipped with a battery charger, discrete power path management, an ultra-low quiescent current DC-DC converter, a 1.14-inch color IPS screen, user-programmable LEDs and buttons, an MFP expansion connector, a reversible USB-C connector, and easy-to-expand header sockets.
