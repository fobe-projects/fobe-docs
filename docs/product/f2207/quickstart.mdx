## Peripheral Interfaces

Besides power and UART connections, the external interface also includes Wakeup and Reset pins for more control over the module.

## GNSS Configuration Jumper

The board features a GALAXY solder pad. Soldering this pad configures the module to use GPS + GLONASS. By default, the pad is not soldered, and the module uses BeiDou + GPS.

## PPS LED Jumper

The board includes a PPS (Pulse Per Second) LED with a jumper. To save power, you can physically cut the trace between the pads of this jumper. You can later re-solder the jumper to reconnect the PPS LED.
