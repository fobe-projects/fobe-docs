## Interfaces
SH1.0 6Pin Connector and Reserved 6Pin Header Holes provide the following interfaces:

  |Interface                           |Description |
  |-------------------------------|---------|
  |3V3 |Power supply       |
  |GND  |Ground       |
  |TX |UART data output       |
  |RX |UART command input       |
  |RST |Reset IC, Low-active      |
  |WAKE |Enable IC's Standby mode, Low-active       |

## Configuration Jumper

The board features two jumper pads:

|Interface                           |Description |
|-------------------------------|---------|
|CONSTELLATION |Soldering this pad configures the module to use GPS + GLONASS. By default, the pad is not soldered, and the module uses BeiDou + GPS. |
|LED-JUMPER |The PPS (Pulse Per Second) LED jumper. To save power, you can physically cut the trace between the pads of this jumper. You can later re-solder the jumper to reconnect the PPS LED. |

## Other
- Build-in 3.1V Rechargeable Button Cell Battery for Data Retention.
- If using an active antenna, the "ACTIVE-ANT PWR" pad needs to be connected to 3V3.
- PPS-PULSE: Outputs a pulse per second, works concurrently with the PPS LED, but not affected by JP2.

## Programming

### FoBE Quill nRF52840 Mesh Example
It can be connected through the MFP port of the FoBE Quill nRF52840 Mesh development board.

```C++
#include <TinyGPSPlus.h>
#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
......
```

Make sure that the GPS module is used in a more open location so that it can get a good GPS signal.
