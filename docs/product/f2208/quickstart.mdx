## Peripheral Interfaces

The board provides two 4-pin SH1.0 connectors and a 6-pin 2.54mm header holes, all providing IIC connections. The header holes also include an INT pin for ADC conversion triggering.

## Address Selection

The IIC address of the ADS1115 can be configured using the B0-B3 solder pads. 

| Pad  | IIC Address (Binary) |
|------|---------------------------|
| B0   | 01001000                        |
| B1   | 01001001                        |
| B2   | 01001010                        |
| B3   | 01001011                        |

## EEPROM Address

The IIC address of the EEPROM can be configured using the A0-A2 solder pads. The  bits [3:1] are A2, A1, and A0. The last bit is determined by the operation: write (0) or read (1).

| A2   | A1   | A0   | IIC Address (Binary) |
|------|------|------|----------------------|
| 0    | 0    | 0    | 1010000x             |
| 0    | 0    | 1    | 1010001x             |
| 0    | 1    | 0    | 1010010x             |
| 0    | 1    | 1    | 1010011x             |
| 1    | 0    | 0    | 1010100x             |
| 1    | 0    | 1    | 1010101x             |
| 1    | 1    | 0    | 1010110x             |
| 1    | 1    | 1    | 1010111x             |

(x: 0 for write, 1 for read)

## External Connection Channels

The board provides a 4-pin 3.81mm terminal block for external connections:

*   Channel 0: 4-20mA current measurement (120 Ohm resistor)
*   Channel 1: Voltage measurement (10k and 39k voltage divider)
*   Channel 2: NTC thermistor measurement (internal 100k resistor)
*   Channel 3: ADC calibration (connected to internal voltage reference)

## ADC-INT Enable

The board provides a reserved solder jumper. Soldering or shorting this jumper enables the ADC-INT function.
