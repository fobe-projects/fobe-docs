## Introduction

FoBE Breakout ADS1115 is a multifunctional analog-to-digital converter module that uses the ADS1115 IC and provides three different measurement inputs: 0-10V voltage measurement, 4-20MA current measurement, and NTC temperature measurement.

This board offers flexible connectivity with two 4-pin SH1.0 connectors and a set of 6-pin 2.54mm header holes, all providing IIC connections. The header holes also include an INT pin for ADC conversion triggering. 


## Applications
- Portable instrumentation
- Battery monitoring
- Temperature measurement
- Factory automation and process controls
