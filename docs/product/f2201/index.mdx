## Introduction

FoBE Breakout LPS22 enables pressure measurement in the range from 260 to 1260 hPa with an accuracy of ±0.1 hPa (after point calibration) or ±1 hPa without calibration. 

The LPS22 has 24-bit resolution with a measurement frequency of 75 Hz. It also allows you to measure the temperature. It can work with systems with a working voltage of 3.3 V or 5 V, and communication is via the I2C interface.

## Applications
- Altimeters and barometers for portable devices
- GPS applications
- Weather station equipment
- Sport watches
