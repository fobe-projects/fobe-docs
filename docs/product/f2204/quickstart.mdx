## Interfaces

The board provides two 4-pin SH1.0 connectors, all providing the same IIC connections for MCU control:

  |Interface                           |Description |
  |-------------------------------|---------|
  |3V3 |Power supply       |
  |GND  |Ground       |
  |SDA |I2C bus data line       |
  |SCL |I2C bus clock line       |

And a set of 6-pin 2.54mm header holes, providing the same IIC connections for MCU control, plus an interrupt pin and a programmable output pin.

  |Interface                           |Description |
  |-------------------------------|---------|
  |INT  |Trigger when the programmed timing conditions are met: Active Low      |
  |GND  |Ground       |
  |3V3 |Power supply       |
  |SDA |I2C bus data line       |
  |SCL |I2C bus clock line       |
  |OUT  |CLK_OUT: Can output programmable square wave: Active Low       |

## Configuration Jumper

The board features two jumper pad:

|Interface                           |Description |
|-------------------------------|---------|
|LED-JUMPER |The PPS (Pulse Per Second) LED jumper. To save power, you can physically cut the trace between the pads of this jumper. You can later re-solder the jumper to reconnect the PPS LED. |
|IIC PULL-UP |By default, sda/scl are pulled up, you can physically cut the trace between the pads of this jumper if you don't need them.|

## Programming
