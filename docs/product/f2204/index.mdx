## Introduction

The FoBE Breakout BM8563 is a real time clock modeule, which provides seconds, minutes, hours, day, date, month, and year information. The number of days in each month and leap years are automatically adjusted. The clock can operate in two modes: one is the 12-hour mode with an AM/PM indicator, the other is the 24-hour mode. The clock/calendar is full binary-coded decimal (BCD).
In addition,  contains a programmable clock output, a timer, an alarm, a voltage-low detector. All address and data are transferred serially via I2C bus and  operates as a slave device on the serial bus. The built-in word address register is incremented automatically after each written or read data byte. 

This board provides two 4-pin SH1.0 connectors and a set of 6-pin 2.54mm header holes, all providing the same IIC connections for MCU control.
