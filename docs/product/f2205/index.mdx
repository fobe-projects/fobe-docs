## Introduction

FoBE Breakout ENS160 is based on ScioSense's ENS160 sensor chip and is specifically designed for indoor air quality monitoring. It offers detection of multiple IAQ data including TVOC, eCO2, and AQI.

The independent hotplate control allows the detection of a wide range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including ethanol, toluene, hydrogen and oxidizing gases with superior sensitivity.

With intelligent on-chip algorithms, the ENS160 can directly output rich and easy-to-understand environmental data. Preheat the sensor for 3 minutes before use to obtain accurate data more quickly. The built-in automatic baseline correction algorithm ensures the long-term stability of the sensor.

## Applications

- Air purification/home automation device
- Environmental pollution detection
- HVAC/Ventilation system
- Building automation/smart thermostat
- Electrical appliances/range hoods
