## Introduction

FoBE Breakout ENS160 based on ScioSense's ENS160 sensor chip, is specifically designed for indoor air quality monitoring and offers detection of multiple IAQ data (TVOC, eCO2, AQI).

The independent hotplate control allows the detection of a wide range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including ethanol, toluene, hydrogen and oxidizing gases with superior sensitivity. 

With intelligent on-chip algorithms, the ENS160 can directly output rich and easy-to-understand environmental data. Preheat the sensor 3 minutes before use then you can obtain accurate data more quickly. What's more, the built-in automatic baseline correction algorithm ensures the long-term stability of the sensor.

## Applications
- Air purification/home automation device
- Environmental pollution detection
- HVAC/Ventilation system
- Building automation/smart thermostat
- Electrical appliances/ range hoods
