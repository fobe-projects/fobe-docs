## Peripheral Interfaces

The board provides two 4-pin SH1.0 connectors and a set of 4-pin 2.54mm header holes, all providing the same IIC connections for MCU control.

## Power LED Jumper

The board includes a power indicator LED with a jumper. To save power, you can physically cut the trace between the pads of this jumper. You can later re-solder the jumper to reconnect the power LED.
