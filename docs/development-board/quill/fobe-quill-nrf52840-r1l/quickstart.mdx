## Power supply

The FoBE Quill nRF52840 R1L is designed to be powered by a battery and provides the charger circuitry for lithium batteries. The charger circuitry can be connected to a wall outlet charger through the Type-C USB connector. The voltage coming from the Type-C USB port goes only to a charger chip. The charger chip detects if the battery needs to be recharged. When the battery is fully charged or the temperature is too high (requires soldering a thermistor module to the NTC test point), the charger chip will stop charging. The output of the charger chip is used to supply the development kit via a step-down converter.

A high-efficiency step-down converter (TPS62825) with a low quiescent current is used for generating 3.3 V. This 3.3 V power supply drives the consumption of the development kit and peripheral modules. The max current supported by the 3.3 V DC-DC is 2A.

### Peripheral Power

**PERI_3V3** is another 3.3 V power supply. It can be controlled by the MCU to cut off power to the MFP (Multi-Function Port) during idle periods to save power. **PERI_3V3** is controlled by the **P1.03** GPIO on the SoC.

        - Set **P1.03**=1, **PERI_3V3** is on.
        - Set **P1.03**=0, **PERI_3V3** is off.

**DISPLAY_EN** and **DISPLAY_BLK** are used to control the display power supply and backlight. They are controlled by the **P0.07** and **P0.27** GPIOs on the SoC, respectively.

        - Set **P0.07**=0, **DISPLAY_EN** is on.
        - Set **P0.07**=1, **DISPLAY_EN** is off.
        - Set **P0.27**=0, **DISPLAY_BLK** is on.
        - Set **P0.27**=1, **DISPLAY_BLK** is off.

### Power consumption

Power consumption measurements are performed when powered by a simulated 3.7V lithium battery.

|Mode                                           |Average Current |
|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|
|SoC in sleep mode, all peripherals off                   | \<18uA   |
|SoC in active mode, all peripherals on, SX1262 in RX mode | \<40mA  |
|SoC in active mode, all peripherals on, SX1262 in TX mode | \<140mA  |

### Voltage measurement

Battery voltage measurement is performed using a set of high-precision thick film resistors. The high-side resistor (R1) is 1M Ohm, and the low-side resistor (R2) is 1.5M Ohm. The SoC's **P0.05** GPIO is connected to the measurement point:

For a voltage divider circuit with two resistors R1 and R2 in series, where Vin is the total input voltage across both resistors, and Vout is the voltage across R2:

**Vout = Vin * (R2 / (R1 + R2))**

By acquiring the voltage at the measurement point using the ADC, the current battery voltage can be obtained according to the formula.

## General purpose I/Os

There are up to 21 multi-function General Purpose I/Os (GPIOs) available on the header pins (7 of which can be used as ADC inputs). These GPIOs are powered from the on-board 3.3V rail and should be used for 3.3V logic level. Any GPIO can be mapped to a digital peripheral (such as UART, SPI, TWI, PDM, I2S, QSPI, PWM, and QDEC) for layout flexibility.

The MFP additionally provides 4 GPIO pins, two of which can be connected to an NFC antenna, or directly connected to modules supporting the MFP interface, or expand to two I2C channels.

## Display

The FoBE Quill nRF52840 R1L features an on-board 1.14-inch full-color IPS display, driven by an ST7789V chip, and mounted on a PETG bracket. It connects to the development board via an FPC (Flexible Printed Circuit) and has a resolution of 135 x 240 pixels with a maximum brightness of 400 cd/mÂ².

## Buttons and LEDs

There are two buttons, one Blue LED connected to dedicated GPIOs on the nRF52840 SoC. The following table shows the Button and LED connections:

| Component | GPIO Pin | Active state |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Reset Button | **P0.18** | ```Low```  |
| USR Button   | **P1.10** | ```Low```  |
| USR LED      | **P0.14** | ```High``` |

## Sub-GHz Radio

The FoBE Quill nRF52840 R1L board features an on-board sub-GHz radio module based on the Semtech SX1262 chip. It supports LoRa and (G)FSK modulation and operates in the 433 MHz, 868 MHz, and 915 MHz frequency bands (model dependent), An integrated 1.8V TCXO ensures excellent stability, unaffected by temperature variations.

Key specifications include an active receive current consumption of just 4.2 mA, a maximum transmit power of up to +22 dBm, and high sensitivity down to -148 dBm, providing excellent interference immunity.

The module connects to the nRF52840 SoC via SPI for long-range wireless communication:

| SX1262 Pin | GPIO Pin | Active state |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| MISO     | **P0.19** | |
| MOSI     | **P0.21** | |
| SCK      | **P0.23** | |
| NSS      | **P1.01** | ```Low``` |
