title: Updating Apps
---

During the installation, Saleor will register the app based on its [manifest](developer/extending/apps/architecture/manifest.mdx).
Besides some basic information, the manifest also includes a list of [permissions](developer/permissions.mdx#app-permissions) and a [subscription webhook payload](/developer/extending/webhooks/subscription-webhook-payloads.mdx) that the app needs to work.

## Updating the app

Currently, Saleor doesn't support automatic app updates. This means that if the permissions, webhooks, or any other manifest field changes, they will not be automatically fetched or reflected in Saleor.

However, there are a few ways how to update the app manually after it is installed:

### Reinstall the app

Reinstalling the app is probably the fastest way to update its manifest. To do that, you need to first remove the old one and then install it again.

Pros of this approach:

- Saleor updates all fields, registers all webhooks again, and provides the new token to the app

Cons of this approach:

- App must support multiple installations - the new token will be generated, and the app must be able to store it.
- If the app stores its settings in the metadata (`app.privateMetadata`), it will be removed, and the app must be configured again.
- Enqueued webhooks from Saleor will fail to be delivered.

This approach works best during development.

## Updating webhooks via mutations

If only webhooks must be updated, the `webhookUpdate` mutation can be used.

Pros of this approach:

- App doesn't have to be reinstalled

Cons of this approach:

- App's manifest will be out of sync, so new installations will revert such mutations. That's why you should also update the manifest

The process of updating the webhooks is described in the [How to update app webhooks](developer/extending/apps/updating-app-webhooks.mdx) guide.

## Updating manifest fields

Some of the manifest fields can be updated via `appUpdate` mutation:

- `name` of the app
- `identifier` of the app
- `permissions` of the app

You can use this mutation to update these fields after the app is installed.

:::warning

Updating `permissions` require token of the user containing `MANAGE_APPS` permission. Effectively, it can't be used by the app itself.
