Official React UI components kit for Saleor. You can find most of the elements used in the creation of Saleor's dashboard interface and use it to create Saleor Apps. Have a great time working on your projects and empowering your users. If you have any questions, feel free to let us know on GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/saleor/macaw-ui/discussions).

Visit our [Storybook](https://macaw-ui.vercel.app) to explore token values and component usage.

## Installation and usage

```bash
npm i @saleor/macaw-ui
```

You need to import the styles into your app. You can do it in your main entry point, for example `index.tsx`:

```tsx
import "@saleor/macaw-ui/style";
```

Next, add the `ThemeProvider` to your app. It will provide the theme to the components:

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "@saleor/macaw-ui";

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider>
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

## Usage with Next.js

If you need to render styles on the server we recommend that you use `getCSSVariables` helper to get the CSS variables that can be injected in `_document.tsx`:

```tsx
import { getCSSVariables } from "@saleor/macaw-ui";
import Document, { Head, Html, Main, NextScript } from "next/document";

const css = getCSSVariables("defaultLight"); // or "defaultDark"

export default class AppDocument extends Document {
  render() {
    return (
      <Html style={css}>
        <Head />
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}
```

## Usage with react-hook-form

You need to wrap the MacawUI component with [Controller](https://react-hook-form.com/docs/usecontroller/controller). For example:

```tsx
import { Input } from "@saleor/macaw-ui";

<Controller
  control={control}
  name="name-input"
  render={({ field }) => <Input {...field} />}
/>;
```
