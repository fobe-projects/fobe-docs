### Attributes configuration

- **Use as filter:** indicates to the storefront that this attribute can be used as a filter. Note that this setting does not change API behavior; its usage is optional. The typical use case is to use this value to configure integration with search engines.

- **Public:** Setting to `True` makes attributes accessible via API without authentication. This is useful when some attributes are private and admins want to hide them from being displayed to customers on product pages.

- **Type:** Select different fields, such as Text, Rich Text, Boolean, etc. The field type can not be changed after creation.

- **Required:** Indicates if the attribute must be filled in by the user before saving the product or content block.

- **Attribute code:** Attribute slug is a unique field identifier. It is a good idea to keep these codes descriptive. For example, instead of `color`, use `shoe-color` so that later, when you add `shirt-color`, you can easily distinguish between them.

- **Default label:** This can provide a human-readable name for the attribute intended for shoppers or admins. These values can be translated in the translation admin panel.

### Product types configuration

- **Tax class:** Default tax class for products of this type. This setting is optional and can be overridden at the product level.

- **Product attributes:** List of attributes that can be assigned to products of this type. A single attribute can be assigned to multiple product types.

- **Variant attributes** List of attributes that can be assigned to variants of products of this type; all variants will have the same fields (but different values). If the attribute is used to distinguish between variants, for example, shoe size, it should be marked as a `Variant Selection`, making it possible to map each `SKU` to a specific attribute value. The `Variant Selection` can be assigned to unlimited attributes to create options selection tables.
- **Is shippable:** Indicates if the product type requires a shipping address to create an order with this product. This setting is helpful for digital products that do not require shipping. The weight is optional and can be used to calculate shipping costs.
