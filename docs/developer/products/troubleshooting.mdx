### Product is not visible in the storefront

Follow this checklist if a product is not visible in the Storefront or API:

1. **Product is published**: Enable `Product is published` and `Available for purchase` for the respective channel. Depending on the storefront implementation, it might be necessary to disable `Hide in product listings`.
2. **Variant is enabled**: At least one `Variant` exists and is set to `Available` for the respective channel. `Price` needs to be higher than zero.
3. **Use correct channel slug**: When querying products, use the correct channel slug instead of channel names, which can contain uppercase letters and white space.

### Product can't be added to an order

Availability of products depends on the customer's location; follow these steps to troubleshoot:

1. Orders are channel-specific; ensure the product is available in the respective channel by following [these steps](#product-is-not-visible-in-the-storefront).
2. Add customer address to the order. Depending on the destination address and the channel, the product might not be available.
3. Find the `Shipping zone` that should be used for the customer's `Shipping` and `Billing` address.

   - Shipping zone should have assigned `Country` matching customer address.
   - The shipping zone should have assigned a `Channel` that matches the order's `Channel`.
   - Shipping zone has at least one `Warehouse` enabled.

4. In the product variant settings, check if the `Warehouses` of the shipping zone have stock (even if the stock tracking is disabled). Only warehouses enabled in the shipping zone are considered for stock availability.

### Product can't be added to a checkout

Checkout is always channel-specific. Products must be available in the respective channel and shipped to the channel's default country (check the channel's settings). To troubleshoot, follow the steps [Product can't be added to an order](#product-cant-be-added-to-an-order).
